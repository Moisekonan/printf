# 0x11. C - printf

## Tasks
### 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
* * c
* * s
* * %
* You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

### 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

Handle the following conversion specifiers:

* d
* i
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

### 2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel

Create a man page for your function.

### 3. With a face like mine, I do better in print

Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
* b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

### 4. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

Handle the following conversion specifiers:

* u
* o
* x
* X
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
